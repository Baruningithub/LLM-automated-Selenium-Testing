# OpenAI automated Selenium Project

## How the project works until now: 

1. This Project uses OpenAI API to generate Selenium script of given html/js pages as prompt.
2. Here we are giving a simple two page html/js one login form followed by one data entry form to the script generator.
2. The generated script is saved and executed in a separate file.
3. We are able succesfully interact with all classes in the login page, move to data entry page, interact with all its classes and finally quit the driver.
